\chapter*{Dedication}
%===================================================================

I couldn't be the person I am today or accomplish anything in my life, including this project, without the help of everyone who has believed in me from day one, especially :\newline


My mother \textbf{Salwa}, who dedicated her life to my sisters and I's success. She has sheltered us from anything that could've stopped us from achieving our goals.\newline

My father \textbf{Rafik},  who has made our lives feel so comfortable and easy throughout the years. He has never hesitated to handle all life's hardships without ever letting trouble reach our home.\newline

My Aunt \textbf{Salma}, for taking me under her wing from the day I moved to Tunis and treating me as a son amongst her children.\newline

My \textbf{family}, for being the greatest people to grow up around, teaching me the most important life lessons and creating the best possible environment to become someone who would make them proud.\newline

My \textbf{friends}, for inspiring me throughout all these years and for being the support and motivation that has gotten me to this next step in my life. I couldn't be here without each and every one of you, and I'll always be there for you.\newline
