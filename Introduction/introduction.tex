The word "Fintech" refers to young, dynamic, innovative companies focused on digital, mobile applications. Their purpose is to offer simple, efficient and cost-effective financial services to the general public and professionals alike. In short, they are companies, usually startups, focused on both finance and technology.\newline

Kaoun, a Tunisian FinTech start-up, is developing a new mobile payment solution, that will allow users to open bank accounts remotely, send peer to peer transaction and even pay merchants.  Meanwhile, merchants are shifting their business's online.  \newline


Since the market is moving towards online payments, Kaoun decided to create its own developer's checkout API for its main product Flouci. This project will expand Flouci to the online payments world and unleash the full potential of the product, also it could take Flouci into new markets and open doors for unlimited integrations.\newline


The following report is a synthesis of the efforts done to build Flouci developers API.
To detail the process of our work, we have divided this report into five chapters representing the different aspects of our project.

In the second chapter, entitled Requirements analysis and specification, we studied the existing solution and went through a profound study of functional and not functional requirements of our project.

In The third chapter, entitled sprint 1:  Project launch, we presented the development disciplines and rules we set during our project development life cycle. It's a detailed explanation of the development practices needed to start our project development in the most efficient way possible. 

In The fourth chapter, entitled 'sprint 2:  User and App management', we started the implementation of our platform and tackled the two main components the user and the integration.

In The fifth chapter, entitled 'sprint 3:  Checkout Module', we made a module that could integrate a Flouci app into any website as a payment method.
