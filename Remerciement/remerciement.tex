\chapter*{Dedication}
%===================================================================

I couldn't be the person I'am today and accomplish anything in my life including this project without the help of everyone who believed in me from day one and especially :\newline


My mother \textbf{Salwa}  who dedicated her life to my sisters and I's success, she sheltered us from any thing that could've altered our path.\newline

My father \textbf{Rafik}  who made our life feels so comfortable and easy throughout the years, bravely taking all life problems and pain without ever letting trouble reach our home.\newline

My Aunt \textbf{Salma} for taking me under her wings from the day i moved to Tunis and counting me as a son among her children.\newline

My \textbf{Family} for being the greatest people to grow up among, teaching me the best life lessons and making the best possible environment to became the best person i could be.\newline

My \textbf{Friends} for being the inspiration during all of this years, for being the support and motivation that get me to the next step in my life. I couldn't be here without each and everyone of you, and i'll always be there for you.\newline
